# A NextJS + React page with Spline Render

I've been completely infatuated with the use of 3D models in website for the past year.
I first came across it on a portfolio website to an award wining graphic design artist where he cleverly
add the head of the Statue of David.

## Few Reasons for this small project

1. I have experience with Blender for webdevelopment
2. I need something that did of the magic of baking for me
3. Spline makes it easy for people with previous experience to hop in and start creating
4. More importantly, once the model is complete the use of it is almost instantaneous
5. I wanted to make an avatar of myself for my portfolio and this was a test run

## Running Locally

1. Make sure you have node version >= 18.2.0;
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
